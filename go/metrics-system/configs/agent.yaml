# Metrics Agent Configuration
# 
# This file configures the metrics collection agent.
#
# Adding a new collector is simple:
# 1. Create the collector file (e.g., internal/agent/collector/myapp.go)
# 2. Add init() function that calls RegisterFactory("myapp", ...)
# 3. Add "myapp" to the collectors list below
# No changes to main.go required!

collection:
  # How often to collect and send metrics
